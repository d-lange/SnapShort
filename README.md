##Purpose

SnapShort: a short story written in a snap. View a prompt and let yourself write what comes to mind. There is no time limit, but the challenge is to create a micro short story from limited rules. 

You can post prompts, write shorts in a snap, and leave actionable, specific and kind feedback through comments.

Try your hand at "shorting" a prompt today!
